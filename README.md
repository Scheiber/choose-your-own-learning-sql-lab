# choose-your-own-learning-sql-lab

I chose to use the SQLBolt and SQLZOO resources.
1. I learned how to use BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN to specify a range when sending a query.
2. I learned how to use IN and NOT IN to query for a particular id.
3. I learned how to use LIKE and NOT LIKE, as well as the percentage sign (%), to query for a sequence of characters.
